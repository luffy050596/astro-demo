## My First Blog Post

 Published on: 2025-05-05

 Welcome to my new blog! Here, I will share my journey of learning about Astro.

### What I did

 1. **Install Astro**：First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online account.

 2. **Make Pages**：Then, I learned how to create new `.astro` files and save them in the `src/pages/` folder to make pages.

 3. **Write Blog Post**：This is my first blog post! Now I have pages made with Astro and a blog post made with Markdown!

### Next Steps

 I will complete the Astro tutorial and then write more content. Follow me for more information.
